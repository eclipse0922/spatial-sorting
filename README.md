# spatial-sorting
Reference implementation and testbed for Spatial Sorting algorithms

Sorting algorithms are self-contained.

Distribution functions depend on GSL - [Gnu Scientific Library](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/).

Test programs also depend on `libcrypto` (SSL) and CGAL - [Computational Geometry Algorithms Library](http://www.cgal.org/).
